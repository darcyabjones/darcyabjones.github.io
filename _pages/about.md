Hi! I'm Darcy.

I'm a PhD student studying Bioinformatics and Fungal Genomics at the [Centre for Crop and Disease Management](http://ccdm.com.au/).
Here I intend to write about coding, bioinformatics, and extremely qualified opinions on some scientific topics that I come across.
This is more for myself than anything, but I'd be delighted if it's useful for anyone.

Have a splendid day!
